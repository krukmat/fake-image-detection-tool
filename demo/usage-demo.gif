# GIF Placeholder

This file will contain the animated GIF demo once created.

## Creating the GIF:

1. Open `animation-demo.html` in a browser
2. Use screen recording to capture 9-12 seconds (3 full cycles)
3. Convert to GIF using online tools like:
   - ezgif.com
   - giphy.com
   - or local tools like FFmpeg

## GIF Specifications:
- Duration: 9-12 seconds (3 cycles of screenshots)
- Size: 800x600 pixels
- Frame rate: 10-15 fps
- File size: Keep under 10MB for GitHub

## Alternative:
For now, we'll use the HTML animation as a demo until a proper GIF is created.
